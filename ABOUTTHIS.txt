the function serveRequest() is written, so I will have to fix that.

FiveOnlySrv.go implements a very simple webserver that (should) only
accept up to five concurrent connections. It listens on port 8181
on the local machine, and will accept any path after the inital
URL, for example 'http://localhost:8181/ThisIsSilly'. On receiving
the message, it waits a random amount of time and then returns a message
like this

concurrentRequests: 0
Currently there are: 1 requests
Milliseconds until completion:	0260.
Done

This is actually a testing requirment for another project. To start,
simply type "go run FiveOnlySrv.go &". Access though a browser, curl,
or a client you have written. A forthcoming version will make this a 
package, turning main into an entry point, RunServer() or something
like that, that can be invoked from its own client or testing tool.
