GoLangStudies
=============

A "workbook" of the owner's studies of/exercises in Go; also
a record of learning how to use Github. No new or brillant code
to be found here. It will be more like a video of an old dog
trying to learn new tricks (where the videocamera is operated
by Grandpa, who keeps complaining that his old Super-8 film
camera was so much simpler.)
